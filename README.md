# Description

This app accepts user input and requests the user to enter the information of team members, starting with the manager information, then the the app gives you the option to either enter an engineer, or an intern, or to finish building the team. When the user selects the engineer option, then the app prompts the user to answer questions for the engineer and when done the app takes the user to the main menu. When selecting the intern option, the app requests the user to enter specific questions about the intern and when done, it takes the user back to the main menu. When the user decides to finish entering the team members and exits the application, a HTML is generated with all the information entered. I was challenged to review and practice all the subjects I have learned through the bootcamp. Some of the last lessons have been hard to understand, and I have been able to get a better grasp of the OOP concept while working on this application.
